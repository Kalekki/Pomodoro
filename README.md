# Pomodoro timer in Svelte
[Try it live!](https://sitruuna.party/focus/)

Simple Svelte app that uses the [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) technique to track your time.

#### Why is the tab showing as playing audio all the time?
In order to for the tab to not hibernate the timer, it's playing a silent audio file.
I'll look into webworkers to fix this.
